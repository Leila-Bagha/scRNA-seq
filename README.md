# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Processing Pipeline

This repository contains a simplified single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data processing pipeline. It's designed to illustrate the basic steps involved in processing scRNA-seq data, from quality control to clustering and visualization, using a mock dataset. This project serves as a conceptual and practical introduction to scRNA-seq analysis.

## Overview

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a detailed view of the cellular composition of tissues, allowing for the exploration of cellular diversity and function at an unprecedented resolution. The processing of scRNA-seq data involves several key steps:

1. **Quality Control**: Initial assessment and cleaning of raw sequencing data.
2. **Read Mapping**: Alignment of sequencing reads to a reference genome.
3. **Quality Control of Aligned Reads**: Filtering of aligned reads based on quality.
4. **Quantification of Gene Expression**: Counting the number of reads/UMIs mapped to each gene.
5. **Normalization**: Adjusting expression counts to account for sequencing depth and other technical factors.
6. **Identification of Highly Variable Genes**: Selecting genes with significant variation across cells for further analysis.
7. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the dataset to a lower-dimensional space for visualization and clustering.
8. **Clustering**: Grouping cells based on similarity in gene expression profiles.
9. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identifying genes that are differentially expressed between defined cell groups.
10. **Annotation and Interpretation**: Assigning cell type identities to clusters and interpreting the biological significance of findings.

## Implementation

This project uses Python to simulate a subset of these steps on a mock scRNA-seq dataset:

- **Mock Data Creation**: Generates a small dataset to mimic gene expression data.
- **Basic Quality Control**: Filters out lowly expressed genes.
- **Normalization**: Scales the data to make it comparable across cells.
- **Highly Variable Genes Identification**: Identifies genes with high variability across the dataset.
- **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering**: Uses PCA and k-means clustering to group cells based on gene expression.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the results of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

### Running the Pipeline

```python
# See included Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step execution
```

## Results

The pipeline outputs a PCA plot with cells colored by their assigned cluster, demonstrating the potential to distinguish cellular populations based on gene expression patterns, even in a highly simplified context.

## Limitations and Real-World Application

This simplified pipeline is intended for educational purposes and to provide a framework for discussion. Real-world scRNA-seq data analysis requires more sophisticated methods and computational resources to handle the complexity and scale of the data.

For a comprehensive analysis, researchers would employ specialized bioinformatics tools and software, addressing challenges such as data sparsity, batch effects, and the identification of rare cell populations.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to demystify the initial steps of scRNA-seq data analysis and provide a hands-on experience with processing such data. This pipeline serves as a starting point for those interested in the field of single-cell genomics.
