# Spatial Data Analysis with Squidpy: Z-Stacks in Mouse Brain Sagittal Slices

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of z-stacks within the Squidpy framework for spatial single-cell analysis. The project focuses on the analysis of Visium 10x mouse brain sagittal slices, showcasing techniques for handling, processing, visualizing, and analyzing spatial single-cell data.

## Objectives

- To demonstrate the loading and preparation of spatial single-cell dataset examples.
- To illustrate the concatenation and analysis of z-stack data using Squidpy.
- To showcase various visualization techniques for spatial data analysis.
- To highlight the processing and segmentation capabilities of Squidpy for spatial datasets.
- To demonstrate feature calculation on z-stack images and their integration with spatial single-cell data.

## Installation

To run the notebook in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your system, along with Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab. The following libraries are also required:

- Anndata
- Scanpy
- Squidpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install anndata scanpy squidpy
```

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone [URL to this repository]
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd [repository name]
```

3. Start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
or
```bash

```

4. Open the `Spatial_Data_Analysis_with_Squidpy.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Key Findings and Visualizations

This project demonstrates the power of spatial single-cell analysis to uncover insights into tissue organization and cellular interactions. Through the application of z-stacks, we explore spatial cellular data in three dimensions, providing a deeper understanding of the cellular composition and heterogeneity within mouse brain sagittal slices.

The repository includes various visualization techniques, from static plots to interactive visualizations, allowing for an in-depth exploration of the spatial relationships within the dataset.
